Get fucked up (and) scream out with me!
I'm living (the) same boring shit everyday
Do you really think this is how you want?
We're all here cuz we know what's fun and not
don't know anything so, don't you dare give up!
Here we go!
I got dumped the other day by my girl...
But today I'll teach you all (the) fun stuff!
Change this floor to a dancing hall, boys & girls!
Dance and make some noise!
Forget about everything!
Get fucked up (and) scream out with me!
Wo-o-o! Wo-o-o!
Don't miss it!
(This) time is yours!
You guys ready? Scream your ass out!
Wo-o-o! Wo-o-o!
I'll burst your brain in pieces
Close your eyes
Shake your fuckin' head
Don't think of anything
Emancipate
The best moment tend to pass by quickly
That is how life is
Get fucked up (and) scream out with me!!
Wo-o-o! Wo-o-o!
Don't miss it!
(This) time is yours!
You guys ready? Scream your ass out!
Wo-o-o! Wo-o-o!
I'll burst your brain in pieces
Wo-o-o!
